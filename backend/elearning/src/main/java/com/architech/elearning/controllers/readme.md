# REST controllers for handling HTTP requests

Holds the REST controllers, which are responsible for handling HTTP requests and returning responses. Each controller corresponds to different features (e.g., UserController, CourseController).

### **Next Steps**

1. **Create the corresponding repository interfaces** for each entity.
2. **Implement services** to handle business logic and interact with repositories.
3. **Test the endpoints** to ensure they work as expected.
4. **Secure the endpoints** using Spring Security as needed.

Feel free to ask if you need help with specific implementations or any other details!
